Code-Splice version 0.01
========================

Removes the contents of a subroutine (usually an anonymous subroutine created
just for the purpose) and splices in into the program elsewhere.

The body of the "code { }" block are extracted from the subroutine and 
inserted in a place in the code specified by the call to the "splice()" 
function.  Where the new code is spliced in, the old code is spliced out.
The "package" and "method" arguments are required and tell the thing how to 
find the code to be modified.

See the POD, please.
